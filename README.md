Project Euler Problems

My attempt at the Project Euler problems
I plan on providing various languages for each problem, primarily Python, C++, and Java, but maybe more such as Haskell or Ruby

I wish to gain feedback on my coding and to grow even more as a coder
So feedback and constructive criticism are always welcome!

Enjoy!
